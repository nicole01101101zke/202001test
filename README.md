# neural network practice
Homework content: This homework mainly hopes to deepen everyone's understanding of neural networks through practice. 
The data set of the job: Mushroom Classiﬁcation data Sources. 
The content of the job is mainly to classify the collected Mushroom data and determine whether it is toxic. 

Job requirements: Use the artificial neural network model built by yourself to complete the Classiﬁcation task, and continuously optimize the model to increase the accuracy to the limit. 
For code implementation, please refer to the handwritten digit recognition sample code neural-networksand-deep-learning in the textbook. 
It is not recommended to use existing integrated Machine Learning libraries, such as keras, sklearn, etc. 
The purpose is to let everyone experience the details of neural network construction.
